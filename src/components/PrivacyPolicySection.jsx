              Children&apos;s Privacy
            </h2>
            <p>
              Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
              personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent
              or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal data, please
              contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from anyone under
              the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that
              information from our servers. If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for
              processing your information and your country requires consent from a parent, we may
              require your parent&apos;s consent before we collect and use that information.
